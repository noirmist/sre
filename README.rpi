The Raspberry Pi X server does not provide an EGL/GLES interface to
transparently support GLES applications. EGL/GLES are only available
in the console, so SRE library applications only run properly in the
console (and also uses a console mouse interface, which doesn't work well
when X is active).

When running Make, the RPi should automatically be detected and the
console GLES2 Raspberry Pi back-end will be compiled in. This back-end
only supports mouse input, so control is mapped entirely to mouse movement
and buttons. The X11-aware GLES2_RPI_FB_WITH_X11 back-end supports the more
versatile mouse and keyboard input used by other X back-ends, which also
supports changing various settings on the fly. When X is detected, the X
mouse and keyboard input interface is used, otherwise console mode (mouse
only) will be active. To enable the GLES2_RPI_FB_WITH_X11 back-end,
edit DEFAULT_BACKEND in Makefile.conf.

Most of the general compilation/installion instructions apply (packages
that need to be installed in order to compile).

The Bullet physics library is required for proper collision detection
in SRE. Although Bullet is available in most Debian distributions,
including armhf for ARMv7, it is not available in Raspbian, so we have
to compile it seperately:

	git clone --depth 1 http://www.github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3
	cd bullet3
	
We need to build the old, compatible version of Bullet (v2.83).
To do so, install cmake if you don't have it yet:

	sudo apt-get install cmake

To compile Bullet cleanly, follow these steps:

	cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"

Edit CMakeCache.txt:

	nano CMakeCache.txt

Since we don't have OpenGL and don't want to build Bullet 3, change the
following settings from ON to OFF, so that only the core Bullet 2 library
is built:

	BUILD_BULLET2_DEMOS
	BUILD_BULLET3
	BUILD_CPU_DEMOS
	BUILD_EXTRAS
	BUILD_OPENGL3_DEMOS
	BUILD_UNIT_TESTS

Then compile and install:

	make
	sudo make install
